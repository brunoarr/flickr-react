# Project_11_Flickr_Gallery_React

In this project, you'll build an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. After creating the project with create-react-app, you will build the gallery components, add to the supplied CSS and set up routing.

(Recommended) Use the flickr.photos.search endpoint/method
Display at least 3 links that return a list of photos matching some criteria. For example: Dogs, Cats and Coffee.
Include a "Search" link that includes a search field to let users search for photos.
Use React Router to set up routes for each navigation link in the directory app.
You can use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API.
You should do all data fetching from a container component that passes the data down to presentational components responsible for displaying images
